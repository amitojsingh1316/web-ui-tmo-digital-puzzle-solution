Code Review
- Function naming do not follow standard naming.(implemented)
- Multiple API calls can be fired for same input value, which can be stopped.(implemented)

Improvements  
- List view would be better than the tabular view as this will show more books on screen and we'll have to scroll less
- Pagination is required, Showing the total number of results returned upfront would be easier for the user
- Sorting and Filtering are essential functionalities
- Read more button required for the description as currently the description is being cut off.
- An button to remove books from reading list should be available beside "Want to Read" button as it will be easier.
- Clicking on the book in Reading List should take us to the Book Details.

Accessibility
 - Imporve color contrast for better accessibility, also changed header color to T-Mobile pink.(implemented)
 - Focusing on tab does not highlight "Want to read" which makes it hard to view.(implemented)
 - Search does not clear the old results until you submit again i.e press Enter it still shows old results from previous search.(implemented)
